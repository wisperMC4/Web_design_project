			Chicken has two nutrients that are great for reducing stress tryptophan and Vitamin B5. Both of them have a calming effect on your body and this makes chicken an excellent option after a stressful day.
			Men should consume foods rich in zinc as it helps regulate testosterone levels as well as boost sperm production.
			Chicken, being rich in vitamin B6, plays an important role in preventing heart attack. Vitamin B6 helps by lowering the levels of homocysteine, one of the key components linked to an increased risk of heart attack. Besides, chicken is also a good source of niacin that helps lower cholesterol.
